			<h2>About</h2>

			<h1>
				Hello,<br />
				I'm Herman<br />
				Lederer
			</h1>

			<p>
				I love exploring abstract ideas and discovering new things. I see opportunities in
				everything and use them to improve my work. I like working on projects that innovate
				and make a difference. Rather than maintaining something that keeps things working
				I prefer to work on something new that can make things better.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been really curious about how games were made since I was a child.
				Game development, however, was too hard for 8-year-old me to comprehend, so for a
				long time being able to make games myself was just a dream.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When I went to middle school I discovered that there was a new programming club.
				I joined it as soon as I got a chance, and there, my journey as a game developer began.
				At first, I learned the basics of web development in that club, then C++ and
				Java by myself, and later took courses on software development.
			</p>

			<p>
				I never felt like I was doing what I wanted to do. Software development was fun,
				but I kept watching videos about cool mods for games I played and new 3d rendering
				techniques and eventually realized that I have to start making that myself. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I went to study at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, which I am soon going to
				finish and I could not be happier about my choice. There I learned to design games
				and turn them into functioning products using tools like Gamemaker or Unity and because
				of their liberal style of teaching, I had a lot of free time that I used to learn
				graphics programming.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am now looking for an internship where I could refine my skills further and
				contribute to making something fun and innovative. Please take a look at my best
				project on the right and contact me if you would like to work together with me.
			</p>
