			<h1>Fast volumetric light for mobile</h1>

			<!--
			<h4>Year</h4>
			<p class="black">2020</p>

			<p>
				This project is a render feature for Unity that
				approximates volumetric light on mobile hardware.
			</p>

			<p>
				The renderer was originally made for a VR training app that
				was meant to run on Oculus Quest. Volumetric lighting was not
				required for the project, but it was a college  project and I happened
				to have had extra time on my hands. I was interested in
				developing my graphics programming skills so I decided to challenge myself
				to make something that would look great and run on low-end hardware.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am a fan of volumetric light. I think it is an essential part
				of making any environment look pleasant. Normally I would use
				Unity's High Definition Rendering Pipeline that has support for
				volumetric fog, but because of hardware limitations, I could not
				do that this time. That is how the idea for this project was born.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have read some material on rendering of volumes with raymartching before.
				Raymarching, however, is a very resource-intensive technique and
				implementing it was out of the question. For some reason, however, my mind
				was refusing to give up one it and at one point I had a realization: I
				don't need to implement raymarching in its standard form! Because I know
				the position, rotation, color, and shape of each light and the atmosphere
				can be assumed to have constant density I can calculate eye ray intersections
				with the light volume, find out when the ray is in the middle of the volume,
				sample light in-scattering at that point, and assume that to be the average
				in-scattering across the ray within the volume.
			</p>

			<p>
				That method worked out perfectly, but there are 2 disadvantages.
				First, there are no shadows in the volume. I only sample a single point
				so it is impossible for this renderer to know what the atmosphere looks
				like before or after the intersection with the middle of the volume. If
				I sample the shadowmap at the middle point and it is shaded, the entire
				ray would also be shaded, which is wrong. But regardless, this project
				is targeted at low-end hardware and shadows are not something
				that is used on it often anyway.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second flaw in this renderer is that it can only reder
				spherical volumes correctly. The technique requires volumes to be symmetric
				around a point, and the only shape  that fulfills  this requirement is a sphere.
				Other shapes do work, but they look wrong from some angles.
				This can be fixed by sampling 3 or more points
				across the volume instead of 1, but I decided to stick with original
				"as fast as possible" philosophy  and relied on artists to use point lights
				wherever they could and use spotlights only where the player could see
				them from the "good" angle.
			</p>

			<p>
				Overall I am very happy with how this project turned out, and this is my
				proudest work at the time of writing (January of 2021).

					<h3>Hero image</h3>
					<p>
						I really like this image. It is an early screenshot from
						a VR game that this renderer was originally made for.
						There are 5 volumetric lights in the scene, the lights on
						the back of the bus, and the blue sphere.

					<h3>Mist from dithering</h3>
					<p>
						This project was originally made for Oculus Quest, and
						the panel on that device introduces strong banding in
						the dark colors. To remedy that I added dithering, but
						when playing with the intensity slider I noticed that it
						made it look like there was mist in the atmosphere. Now
						stong dithering is a stylistic part of the project.

					<h3>Supports spot lights</h3>
					<p>
						Because the volumetric lights are drawn as additive full
						screen quads they can be any shape that can be described
						with mathematics. There is support for point and spot
						lights, but other shapes can be easily added to the
						renderer. I plan to add cube, frustum, cylinder, and
						capsule volumes in the future.

					<h3>Volume approximation</h3>
					<p>
						The way volumes are calculated is inspired by
						raymarching, but unlike raymarching, my method does not
						use any loops. This renderer calculates light
						in-scattering using a single sample in the middle of
						each volume. This is faster to calculate but looks
						wrong when volumes have sharp edges, like, for example,
						the base of the white cone on this image.
