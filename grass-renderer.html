			<h2>About</h2>

			<h1>Grass renderer with chunks and LODs</h1>

			<p>
				This project is a grass population and rendering system for
				Unity's High Definition Rendering Pipeline that can render Infinite fields of
				animated grass.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back in the spring of 2020, I was working on a college project that required me
				and my team to make a game. My team wanted to have high level of polish on
				level design so I tried to provide them with the best tools to make that possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				Adding foliage is an easy way to make outdoor  scenes look nice and detailed.
				We were using HDRP, and at the time it did not have support for foliage rendering
				so the responsibility of creating a foliage system fell on me. Eventually, the group
				decided to change the direction and not have any outdoor scenes in the game.
				This project was put on a shelf for a while, but I came back to this project and
				finished it in the summer of 2020.
			</p>

			<p>
				This project mainly consists of two components: the grass population system and
				the grass renderer. The way the population system communicates with the renderer is
				a point cloud mesh. The population system generates meshes of many points that
				serve as grass origins. These meshes are rendered with a modified HDRP Lit shader
				that has a geometry program in it. The geometry program calculates the
				distance from the point to the camera and picks an LOD. Based on which lod is picked,
				it then constructs 1, 2, or 3 quads with UV coordinates. HDRP Lit shader then takes
				care of rendering it as it would render any other material.
			</p>

			<p>
				Grass population system itself is quite simple. It splits the world in chunks
				to achieve infinite coverage. The size and the amount of chunks is adjustable from
				the inspector. The populator chunks into an object pool to optimize resource usage.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whenever a chunk is loaded it runs a grass population process that generates the
				point cloud mesh. It uses raycasts from a constant, camera-dependant height at random x
				and z positions to find the top of whatever suitable surface it finds, and adds a point
				to its mesh at that position.
			</p>

			<p>
				When I finished this project I was only beginning to learn graphics programming.
				While a project like this is expected to be resource-intensive I believe
				I can improve it further by using large triangles instead of quads, calculating LOD levels
				on the CPU and saving generated point cloud meshes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite that, I really like what I achieved with my first graphics programming project.

					<h3>Settings</h3>
					<p>
						These are the settings that the grass population system allows to change.
						The population doesn't have to be a grass population system,
						it can take any material and render the point with it, but it does
						assume that the shader needs the parameters it passes to the grass shader.
