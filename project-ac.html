			<h2>About</h2>

			<h1>
				Project-AC
			</h1>

			<p>
				This project is a 2-player competitive infinite runner game where you
				place and break AC units to make your way up and outrun the opponent.
			</p>

			<p>
				This game was created for a college project that required me and my team to
				make a game in the Unity engine. It happened so that I was the only developer
				in the group with 2 artists and 2 designers, so the full honor of discovering Unity
				was mine.
			</p>

			<p>
				The gameplay programming consists of 3 main things: player movement,
				AC unity manipulation, and background generation. I started out implementing player
				movement by using Unity's 2D physics. At first, it was simple, just add forces to the
				rigidbodies and the movement is done, but that simplicity ended when we decided that
				we wanted the players to be able to stand on the rooftops and only collide with
				AC units from the top. I considered using one-way colliders, but that couldn't solve
				the problem because we were using 2D physics and there was a lot of overlap in the
				Z coordinate (buildings layered on top of each other). Because of that, I ended up
				making my own physics system for this project. I used raycasting to Unity colliders,
				but all processing of forces and collisions was custom-made.
			</p>

			<p>
				To enable the players to see their actions best the camera stayed centered between
				both players and zoomed in or out based on how far apart they were. There is one more
				thing I would implement If I had the skills then that I have now, I would
				make the screen split in two and have two cameras follow each of the players if they
				are too far apart.
			</p>

			<p>
				To climb the rooftops, players have to place AC units on the sides of the buildings.
				To make them align with the buildings we decided to use grids. Whenever a player
				placed an AC unit, its position is divided by cell size, rounded, and multiplied by
				the cell size back. That results in AC units snapping to the grid. The players have
				16 units at their disposal when they start, but to keep moving forward they
				have to stop on the rooftops where they can find more AC units and collect them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The AC units on the rooftops are generated randomly, just like the background itself.
				The buildings were aligned to the same grid as the AC units, that made it quite easy
				to generate the background. What I ended up doing is I stored the heighest rooftop Y point and
				every time one of the players was close enough for it to almost be visible on the screen,
				I looped through the row of cells at that point, raycasted down and spawned a new
				building centered at the intersection point.
			</p>

			<p>
				This being my first ever Unity game I am extremely happy with how it turned out. I was
				purprised how much I was able to make right away. The game was also really fun to play
				and looked nice. To this day I still enjoy showing this game off to people and have
				a little fun playing it.

					<h3>Title screen</h3>
					<p>
						The game has the title screen. Eventhough it adds nothing to the gameplay,
						I think it adds a lot to the game. There is something in being able to close 
						the game by pressing a button instead of having to hit Alt f4.

					<h3>Controls</h3>
					<p>
						The controls in this game are not standard, so we had to show them to
						the players. We made it so the players can practice in the background of

					<h3>Beginning of the game</h3>
					<p>
						The players spawn on the ground standing next to each other and
						holding 16 AC units. To prevent the players from getting soft locked,

					<h3>Gameplay screenshot</h3>
					<p>
						This is another gameplay screenshot. The AC units that are placed by
						the players fall off after a short period of time. To make it easier to
						tell whether the unit is safe or not, the player placed ones
						light up in player colors.
